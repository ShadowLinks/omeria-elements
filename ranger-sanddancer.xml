            <p>Dreadfields is home to countless unimaginable horrors. In the past, the northwestern states of the Tadju Confederacy struggled to defend themselves from the constant assaults wrought by its creatures. Eventually, the city of Çakikaya in Hasastan decided to take a page from their neighbor Castlegrasp’s book. They imbued their greatest warriors with the elemental magic present in the terrain itself. This resulted in an elite group of rangers dubbed Sand Dancers.</p>
            <p class="indent">The art of Sand Dancing has since spread to other parts of the Tadju Confederacy, particularly the western and southernmost regions that firmly straddle the Desolation of Ditimaya.</p>
            <p class="indent">Most Sand Dancers are rarely seen within the city from which they’re born; instead, they spend most of their time out in the wilderness, acting as the Tadju Confederacy’s first line of defense. While not as disciplined as the Stonearms of Castlegrasp, Sand Dancers are just as deadly as the paladins, if not more so.</p>
