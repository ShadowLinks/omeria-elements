            <p>Remote traveler suits allow arcane spellcasters to project their consciousness into constructs. The spellcaster sees the world through the eyes of its remote traveler. This allows the spellcaster to experience the world without ever leaving the safety and comfort of their home. The first prototypes for these suits were invented in the late 9th century.</p>

            <p>You gain access to a remote traveler suit which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. To pilot the suit, you must conduct an hour-long ritual that binds your consciousness to the suit. Once bound to the suit, half of any damage the suit takes (rounded down) is transferred to you as psychic damage. Damage dealt this way ignores resistances or immunities to psychic damages.</p>
            <p class="indent">In combat, the suit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the suit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
            <p class="indent">On your turn, as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. This connection lasts until you end the connection as an action, you and your suit are on different planes of existence, or the suit is destroyed. While piloting the suit in this way, the suit uses your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as any saving throws and skill proficiencies related to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can expend one 1st-level spell slot to mend the suit. The suit regains 2d6 hit points. When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the hit points the suit regains increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a long rest, you can create a new remote traveler if you have smith’s tools with you. You must then reestablish your psychic connection with the new suit, spending 1 hour to do so. If you already have a suit from this feature, the first one no longer functions. The suit stops functioning if you die.</p>
