            <p>Perhaps the name mage is deceptive. After all, the Vaskil Warriorbrood are hardly mages. Certainly, magic flows through their veins, along their arm, into their trigger fingers, and through their firearms. But this magic is not the magic of the cloistered wizards of Odonburg or the stalwart abjurers of Presson’s Enclave. Nor is it powered by the elementals who built Grand Casar. But their magic is the true magic: the magic of self, fueled by the purest existence.</p>
            <p class="indent">Forbidden to use magic by their Pressonian masters, the Anorians were instead awarded the pistol, a primitive weapon invented during the Year of Fire by the azers. But they accepted this gift and made it their own. Guns in hand, the Warriorbrood is a force to be reckoned with.</p>

            <p>Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of firearms (see below). You gain proficiency with firearms if you don’t already have it, and these weapons are monk weapons for you. You also gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You ignore the loading and reloading properties for firearms with which you are proficient.</li>
                <li>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.</li>
                <li>You can draw or stow two one-handed firearms when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You learn how to shower your enemies in a hail of gunfire few can avoid. As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to create a 30-foot cone of bullets. To do so, you must be wielding a firearm and it must be loaded. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC. A target takes the damage normal for your firearm on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a success. This attack expends only one piece of ammunition.</p>
