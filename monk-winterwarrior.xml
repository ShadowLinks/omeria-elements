        <description>
            <p>Monks who follow the Way of the Winter Warrior train in the harshest parts of the world, particularly those subject to year-round freezing conditions. These disciplined fighters hone their skills to become defensive combatants capable of withstanding extreme punishment from the large and dangerous creatures native to polar environments.</p>
            <p class="indent">The most famous school of Winter Warriors in Omeria were the Brothers of Xidar. Now extinct, this exclusively Tathdarian elven monastery created hundreds of monks who followed this tradition until they mysteriously vanished sometime around 500 AT.</p>

            <p>You can use your bonus action to spend 2 ki points to create a chilly fog that extends from you 10 feet in all directions. The area inside the fog is lightly obscured. While the fog is active, any hostile creature that ends its turn in the fog must make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes cold damage equal to your martial arts die and its movement speed is reduced by half until the end of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and its movement isn’t affected. The fog lasts for as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute.</p>
