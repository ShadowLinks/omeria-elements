            <p>Once a proud race of warriors who worshiped the demonic god of death and winter, Vapul, the Anorians now rely on their natural affinity to the forest and the land to survive under the rule of Presson’s Enclave and its Mydon Princes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Anorians are best known for their use of archaic weaponry called firearms, which they rely on as a substitute for magic from which they are banned.</p>

            <p>Olyothyrians are sometimes referred to as “high elves” in Omeria. They hide within the forests of Omeria’s northwestern coast. Two factors force them to remain hidden in their glades. First, their mortal enemies, the goblins of Gar Wabrizz and their magic sensing pets, the dokh nuzegh, keep them from expanding east. Second, if the elves travel too far from their home, they become sick and eventually die. The distance this mysterious curse allows them to travel continues to shrink each year.</p>

            <h4>Olyothyrian Traits</h4>

            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Elf Weapon Training.</em>
                </strong>
                You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

                <strong>
                    <em>Cantrip.</em>
                </strong>
                You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <strong>
                    <em>Extra Language.</em>
                </strong>
                You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.
            </p>

                <strong>
                    <em>The Traveler's Curse.</em>
                </strong>
                Whenever you complete a long rest more than 500 miles from the city of Olyothyr (specifically, the Burning Rose at Sanev Plaza), you must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for the saving throw equals 5 plus the number of days you’ve been away. On a failed saving throw, your hit point maximum is reduced by 1d4. If your hit point maximum is reduced to 0, you die, and your body discorporates into nothingness. Otherwise, this reduction lasts until you finish a long rest within 500 miles of Olyothyr.

            <p>Although the Obi civilization was largely eradicated from Omeria, there are still a few elves in the world who can claim the Obi as their ancestors. And these ancestors, having lived around ruby blutvekzelnite for so long, possess an affinity for transmutation and change.</p>
            <p class="indent">Obi have a natural green tint to their skin which provides camouflage in forests and jungles. They also have dark eyes, sometimes pitch black, with yellow irises, that give them a fiendish quality</p>

            <p>Tathdarian elves are dark-skinned, white-haired elves native to the frosty regions of northern Omeria. They are sometimes confused for Anorians due to their affinity for cold weather. Ironically, the Tathdarians have long fought against the demonic god Vapul and his undead legions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Less than one hundred Tathdarians are alive today. They mostly keep to themselves but are known to work alongside the humans that live on the Syhros Peninsula.</p>
