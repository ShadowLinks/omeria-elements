        <description>
            <p>Wasteland druids are cruel spellcasters devoted to the total destruction of life. Even plant life has no place in their world. In the mind of the wasteland druid, Omeria belongs only to the four basic elements.</p>
            <p class="indent">Circle of Wastelands druids are rarely of good or lawful alignment. Neutral wasteland druids are common, as are chaotic evil ones. In the rare occasion where these druids work alongside other humanoids, they do so only as a means to an end. Whatever brief moments of humanity they exhibit quickly get buried under their unwavering dedication to the unblemished world of their fantasies.</p>

            <p>Your magic pulls heavily from the four basic elements. This connection provides you the tools necessary for the eradication of life in the form of spells. You gain these spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Wastelands Spells table</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

            <p>Your innate hatred of living creatures imbues you with destructive might. Choose a creature type that you despise: aberrations, beasts, dragons, giants, monstrosities, or plants. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as humans and elves). You have advantage on spell attacks made against these creatures.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can use your bonus action on each of your turns to soften a creature’s defenses against your magic.
