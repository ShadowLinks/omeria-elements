            <p>Blending the techniques and stealth of assassins and rogues, the Dinzer Ghosts haunt the Three Great Wasteland like careful predators. They are also found on The Leash, keeping a watchful eye on the goings-on of their adversaries on the Weysevain Coast.</p>

            <p>You are an expert at taking advantage of your opponent while their guard is down. Once per turn, you can add your proficiency bonus to your damage roll on one attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>

            <p>You can use your bonus action to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by a target’s Wisdom (Insight) check. The target must be within 30 feet of you and able to see you. If the check is successful, the target is frightened of you until it takes damage or until the end of its next turn. While the creature is frightened of you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If the target succeeds on the contest or the effect ends for it, it is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature three times and regain all expended uses after you complete a long rest.</p>

            <p>As a bonus action, or as a reaction when a creature hits you with an attack roll or harmful spell, you can become incorporeal. While incorporeal, you gain resistance to all damage except for radiant and force damage, including from the triggering attack. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You remain incorporeal as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute, until you make an attack or cast a spell, or you use your bonus action to end the effect.</p>
