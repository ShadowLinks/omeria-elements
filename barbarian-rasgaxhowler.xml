            <p>Perhaps the greatest warriors in all of Northern Omeria (if not all of Omeria), the Howlers are dangerous barbarians whose mortifying howls can be heard across the plains on which they ride.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition to their howls, Rasgax Howlers are known for their exceptional riding skills. Whether mounted on warhorses, go-krorols, or even giant vultures, mounted Rasgax Howlers are a force unto themselves.</p>

            <p>You can emit ear-splitting howls capable of stopping your enemies in their tracks. While raging, any creature who targets you with an attack or a harmful spell that can hear you must first make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Creatures immune to being frightened automatically succeed on their saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on its attack rolls against you until your rage ends. If the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw, it is immune to this trait until your rage ends. This effect doesn’t protect you from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.</p>
