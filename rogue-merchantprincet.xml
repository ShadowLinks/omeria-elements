        <description>
            <p>After The Transmuter Wars destroyed central Omeria, many of the surviving Ditimayans and Karnionians moved to Central Omeria’s edges. Soon, The Wound, the large sea dividing the Summer Land from Central Omeria, became home to tribal nations and city-states. Today, these young nations comprise the Tribal Confederation of Mighty Tadju. Tadju’s position on The Wound as well as the vast swaths of desert it claims earns it the top honor as Omeria’s center of trade. In fact, Tadju mints four out of every five coins in Omeria.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tadju’s founders were survivors. They understood the value of negotiation and were not above underhanded dealings. Three hundred years ago, other Omerians called them rogues. But with great power comes great respect. Today, Omerians refer to them by their preferred titles: merchant princets. Of course, little has changed about the way they do business.</p>
