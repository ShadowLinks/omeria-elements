            <p>Esoteric delvers are wizards obsessed with forbidden lore, hidden secrets, and discovering the unknown. Many of Omeria’s esoteric delvers hail from Odonburg, but there are plenty to be found in Northern Omeria as well. Many of the mages who work in the Archivist’s Sanctum Library and Desneorus consider themselves esoteric delvers, as do many of Steel Church’s Adherents.</p>
