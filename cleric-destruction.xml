            <p>Only the most devoted followers of Yrena achieve the status of priest. Empowered by this direct relationship with their “god,” they have access to some of the deadliest forms of magic in all Omeria. Of course, Yrena isn’t the only danaavrakti whose portfolio includes destruction. Minteco and Hulay, on the rare occasion they take followers, also grant the powers of destruction.</p>
