        <description>
            <p>Imbued ones have a lot in common with Hands of the Eight. Both draw their power from one or more of the eight arcane energies of the Cosmos. However, imbued ones are sorcerers who draw their power from one specific energy versus all eight. Imbued ones can trace their bloodlines back to one of three sources: the titans, danaavrakti, or elves. As such, humans and other races not created or related to one of these sources rarely possess the innate ability to wield imbued one magic.</p>

             As an action, you can touch a humanoid that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. The creature becomes your undead servant. It is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. The creature uses the Undead Servant stat block below. It uses your proficiency bonus in several places.
             In combat, the servant acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you have more than one attack when you take the Attack action, you can sacrifice one of your attacks to command the servant to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the servant can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
             If the servant was destroyed within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The servant returns to life (or unlife, as it were) after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.
             When you finish a long rest, you can animate a new undead servant targeting a new corpse. If you already have an undead servant from this feature, the previous servant unanimates when the new servant animates. The servant also unaminates if you die.</description>
