    <p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four Elemental Planes—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the Ethereal.</p>
    <p class="indent">At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air.</p>
    <p class="indent">From these planes the elementalist draws power.</p>

            <p>Your innate connection to the inner planes grants you the use of magic, which you can convert to spells.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong> Inner Planes Bound. You produce elementalist magic effects through your innate connection to the Ethereal Plane, Inner Planes, and Material Plane. So long as you are on these planes of existence, you do not require material components (spells whose components list are marked “M”) except for components with a listed cost. If you leave these planes of existence, you must have the correct material components or an elementalist focus (see the sidebar) in order to cast spells with material components.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong> Elementalist Focus. If you are ever outside the Ethereal Plane, Inner Planes, or Material Plane, you must carry an elementalist focus in order to cast spells with material components. The following items are common foci for elementalists: copper rod (10 gp, 2 lb.), crystal (10 gp, 1 lb.), powdered sulfur (20 gp, ½ lb.), vial of pure spring water (5 gp, no cost).</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong> Cantrips (0-Level Spells). You know two cantrips of your choice from the elementalist spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional elementalist cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Elementalist table.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you gain a level in this class that grants you an Ability Score Improvement, you can replace one of the elementalist cantrips you know with another cantrip from the elementalist spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong> Preparing and Casting Spells. The Elementalist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your elementalist spells. To cast one of your elementalist spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of elementalist spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the elementalist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of elementalist spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your elementalist level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 7th-level elementalist, you have four 1st-level and three 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 15, your list of prepared spells can include five spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell burning hands, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of elementalist spells requires time spent drawing power from the Inner Planes: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong> Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your elementalist spells: your connection to the greater multiverse, particularly the Inner Planes, allows you to wield these spells with expertise. You use your Wisdom whenever an elementalist spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an elementalist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            </center>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong> Ritual Casting. You can cast an elementalist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
        </description>
        <sheet>
            <description>If you are on the Ethereal, Inner, or Material Plane, you only need material components for with a listed cost. Otherwise you need the componenets or an Elemental Focus.
            When you gain a level in this class that grants Ability Score Improvement, you can replace a Cantrip you know with another.
            You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest and takes 1 minute per spell level for each spell.
            You can cast spells as rituals that have the ritual tag.</description>
