            <p>When the Transmuter Wars of the mid-7th century made trade and travel through the newly formed wastelands next to impossible for merchants, the trade governors of Malembia saw an opportunity. The new dangers inherent in The Wither, Obsidian Plain, and Desolation of Ditimaya would mean fewer safeguards against the transportation of illegal goods. Without hesitation, the trade governors seized the opportunity. They hired brave (and often insane) transporters to traverse the wastelands with their goods. These traders gained the moniker Deadrunner. Three hundred years later, the Deadrunner tradition continues. And while Deadrunners rarely earn as much as they did in those early years, dead running is still one of the best ways for aspiring adventurers to cut their teeth on Omeria.</p>

            <p>When you officially become a Deadrunner, you gain proficiency in land vehicles and smith’s tools. Additionally, you gain a vehicle. Most Deadrunner vehicles are ramshackle, wheeled monstrosities powered by outdated (and dangerous) elemental engines. Choose the type of vehicle with which you wish to start—Deadrunner Rhino, Deadrunner Sand Fox, or Deadrunner Viper. The vehicle uses your proficiency bonus in several places.</p>
            <p class="indent">The helm of your vehicle is specifically attuned to you. Other creatures may use the helm; however, only you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using your vehicle’s ability scores.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the mending spell is cast on your vehicle, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has been destroyed within the last hour, you can use your smith’s tools to repair its functionality, provided you are within 5 feet of it. The vehicle regains its functionality after 1 hour with all its hit points restored.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a long rest, you can retool your vehicle if you have smith’s tools with you. Choose a new stat block to represent your retooled vehicle.</p>

            <p>On your turn, you can expend 10 feet of movement to perform one free vehicle stunt, such as a wheelie or a burnout. You must be inside your dead runner vehicle to use this stunt. Before the stunt can be performed, your vehicle must move at least 10 feet in a straight line. If you succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check using the vehicle’s Dexterity, the stunt is successful. Otherwise, you are unable to perform the stunt and can’t attempt another stunt until the start of your next turn. If the check fails by 5 or more, you and all creatures riding it immediately fall prone as the vehicle wipes out and comes to a dead stop.</p>
            <p class="indent">After you succeed on a stunt, you may choose one of the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The next attack roll made from one of your vehicle’s action stations is made with advantage so long as the attack is made before the end of your current turn.</li>
                <li>The next attack roll made against you, the vehicle, or any other creature inside the vehicle is made with disadvantage so long as the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</li>
                <li>You target one creature that can see your vehicle within 30 feet of your vehicle. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the vehicle’s Strength modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target becomes frightened of your vehicle until the end of its next turn.</li>
