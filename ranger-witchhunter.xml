            <p>The Witch Hunters of Aspaeth are a 500-year-old organization dedicated to the eradication of transmuters and other practitioners of dark magic. The Witch Hunters were originally tribal warriors inhabiting the lands of Aspaeth (known as Izu in their time). When the Pressonian settlers brought the plague of transmutation to their lands, the Witch Hunters, under the leadership of Isik the Yellow-Eyed, united to drive them out. The process took nearly a century, culminating in The Transmuter Wars.</p>
