            <p>Just a little over a decade ago, a mysterious faction appeared in the city Mighty Tadju. Calling themselves The Paragons of the True Emperor, this autocratic faction rejected Tadju and Hasastan’s leaders, citing that the church of Xardos should have no hand in government. Originally, these protests were peaceful, but they soon grew violent.</p>
            <p class="indent">Known to few, the organization is guided by a select group of warlocks who draw power directly from their so-called True Emperor, an as yet unrevealed entity. These manipulative warlocks keep to the shadows, content to use their illegal enchantments to charm and dominate important figures within their organization.</p>
